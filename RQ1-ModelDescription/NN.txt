NN is a benchmark representing the a permanent magnet that levitates thanks to an electro-magnet
It receives as input the desired position of the magnet and evaluates
	1. the position error of the magnet (depending on reference position and actual position).
	2. the actual position of the magnet

The electromagnet is controlled by a NARMA-L2 controller. The most critical positions are the ones near the extremities of the domain, far from the midway point at 2.

Requirement NN: If the positioning error gets above a given threshold, than it will have to remain under the threshold for at least 2 consecutive seconds of the next 3 s.

Simulation conditions:

	Input: Magnet reference position
		Range: 1 - 3
		Control Points: 3
		Interpolation function: cubic spline

	Simulation time: 40 s
