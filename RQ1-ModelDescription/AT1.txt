AT is a benchmark representing the Automatic Transmission of a car.
It receives as input the throttle and brake signals from the driver and evaluates:
	1. the vehicle speed
	2. engine speed
	3. current gear (1 to 4)

Since the relation between input and outputs of this model is intuitive and well-known, no other detail will be provided on the model.

Requirement AT1: In the first 20 seconds, the vehicle speed must always be below 120 km/h.

Simulation conditions:

	Input 1: Throttle
		Range: 0 - 110
		Control Points: 7
		Interpolation function: cubic spline

	Input 2: Brake
		Range: 0 - 100
		Control Points: 3
		Interpolation function: cubic spline

	Simulation time: 50 s
